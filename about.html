<p>Welcome to my blog about programming ! My name is Enrique and I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela. I arrived to Miami, Florida in 2011 to study Economics with a minor in International Business. After I graduated from college I realized that I was not enjoying my what I was doing with my life, so I decided to take a chance with programming. So far I love it and I can wait until I am able to create my own applications. I hope that you enjoy my blog and be able to learn something from it. </p>
